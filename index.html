                <p>Hi! My name is Leisa. I am married and have four kids. For the past twenty-five years I worked as a
                    volunteer dentist on the working poor. I spent most of my time raising three sons and one daughter.
                    My husband is a vitreo-retinal surgeon. Our son, Shep IV, is 25, and is in the Phd Physics program
                    at ASU. Our daughter, Jaimie, is 24, and is in medical school at University of Florida. Eric is a
                    double Math and Physics major at Barrets. Our youngest, Alec, is a first year student at The
                    University of Chicago and will be studying Data-Analytics Economics. He also will be playing
                    basketball for UChicago.  I like to hike, run, swim,go to F45 and am involved in Impact Church.  </p>
